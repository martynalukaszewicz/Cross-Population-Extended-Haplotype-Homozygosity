# Cross-Population-Extended-Haplotype-Homozygosity 


## Abstract
The code derives unstandardized expected haplotype homozygosity, a statistic used to identify selective sweeps. Function written for the bi-allelic SNPs case, (0,1), for statistic calculation between two populations. Function written in R. The function returns unstandardized XP-EHH, equation (1) in A Map of Recent Positive Selection in the Human Genome by Voight et al. Link to Voight et al. paper:

## Algorithm

Computation steps for calculation of unstandardized XP-EHH are described in Appendix S4 of Voight et al. paper:
